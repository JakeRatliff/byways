## Building

To preview the website:

    npm install
    make components preview

## Contributing

Fork and have fun. We take patches and update hosted version regularly.
If you modify .js files make sure you `make lint` it.

If you work for any of the organizations that used to contribute to `byways.org` and want to update
information on your byway but don't feel like dealing with this `git` thing, drop us an e-mail at
[byways@code42day.com]

## License

We believe the content of the website (.json files in the `contents` directory) is in public domain.
It was available from `bywaysonline.org` run by [FHWA] before that site and the byways program was
defunded. If you think otherwise please contact us at [byways@code42day.com]

Everything outside of the `contents` directory (styles, javascript, jade templates etc.) is
published under MIT license.
