  "fullDescription": "<p>Ocoee Scenic Byway, the first National Forest Byway in the nation, winds through the Cherokee National Forest, passing Parksville Lake and traveling through the scenic bluffs of the Ocoee River Gorge. One section of the byway climbs to the top of the Chilhowee Mountains in Tennessee. From here, you capture magnificent views of the Tennessee Valley, the Cumberland Plateau, the Blue Ridge Province, and on a clear day, views of North Carolina and Georgia.</p><p>Along with scenic views, the byway offers a variety of recreational opportunities. Parksville Lake (Lake Ocoee) provides visitors with opportunities for swimming, boating, fishing and camping. Ocoee River, on the other hand, attracts whitewater adventurists. Canoing, rafting, and kayaking are popular activities at the Ocoee Whitewater Center along the Ocoee River, site of the 1996 Olympic Canoe/Kayak Slalom competition.</p><p>And if white water adventure is not for you, visit the</p><p>historical remnants along the byway. The area, once inhabited by the Cherokee Indians, and later a Civil War site, is rich in history. The byway was also once a part of the Old Copper Road, where horse-drawn wagons transported copper ore from Copperhill and Ducktown to Cleveland Ohio.</p><p>From high adventure, to scenic views, to rich history, there is something for everyone on the Ocoee Scenic Byway.</p><p></p>",
