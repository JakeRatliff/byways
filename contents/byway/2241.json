  "fullDescription": "<p>Pass corn fields, native grasses, wildflowers and the Shooting</p><p>Star Recreational Trail when driving along the Shooting Star Scenic</p><p>Byway in the Historic Prairie Country of Minnesota. The towns of</p><p>Adams, Rose Creek, Taopi, and LeRoy combine to give this byway a</p><p>small town touch. These communities combine with the natural beauty</p><p>of the prairie and the unique wildflowers for which this byway is</p><p>named.  </p><p>The route passes through rich agricultural regions and small</p><p>rural towns with historic buildings of national significance, bed</p><p>and breakfasts, golf courses, swimming pools and city parks. Lake</p><p>Louise State Park is also located on this route, offering visitors</p><p>and residents alike with multiple opportunities to enjoy the</p><p>Minnesota Prairie.  </p><p>This official Minnesota Scenic Byway is one of the state&#8217;s</p><p>first designated wildflower routes. The Minnesota Department of</p><p>Transportation and Natural Resources collaborate to manage</p><p>wildflowers and native grasses along the route.  </p><p></p>",
