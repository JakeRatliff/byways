  "fullDescription": "<p>This byway sits in the pulsing heart of Manchester, the state's largest city, commercial and industrial hub, and cultural center.</p><p>Masses of top-notch family attractions are so close together</p><p>that it's easy to pack a lot into a day. Make sure to pack in the cultural and historic while you're here: don't leave without visiting places like the Currier Gallery of Art and the newly-restored Palace Theater.</p><p>Because of its excellent acoustics and large stage, the Palace</p><p>Theater is home to the New Hampshire Symphony and the Opera League of New Hampshire. It also serves touring companies and musicians and community performance groups.</p><p>The Manchester special events calendar is filled the throughout the year with old-fashioned country fairs, holiday parades, fireworks, art exhibits, performances by the symphony and opera, trade shows, and the ballet.</p><p>The region surrounding the route, the Merrimack Valley region,</p><p>is unique in itself. It has inspired poets, pollsters and political pundits; the latter two flock here every four years looking to New Hampshire as the bellwether in the presidential primaries.</p><p>Just as New Hampshire's residents offer insight into</p><p>national psyche (politically speaking), the Merrimack Valley Region embodies much of what makes New Hampshire unique: this quiet and colorful region embraces three of the state's major cities and remains surprisingly rural. And in many places, the heart of a city and a dairy farm with its quiet country roads are within ten driving minutes of each other.</p><p></p>",
