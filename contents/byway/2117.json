  "fullDescription": "<p>Though it's the shortest of Colorado's twenty-one byways, the</p><p>South Platte River Trail is long on history. Thousands of</p><p>Fifty-Niners passed this way to Denver and the mines beyond in the</p><p>early days of the Pikes Peak rush. The 19-mile loop includes stops</p><p>at the site of the only Pony Express station in Colorado, where</p><p>15-year-old William F. Cody - Buffalo Bill - signed in as a rider;</p><p>the location of old Fort Sedgwick, established in 1865 to guard</p><p>westward migrants from Indian raids; and the spot where Cheyenne,</p><p>Arapaho, and Sioux warriors attacked a detachment of cavalrymen to</p><p>avenge the Sand Creek Massacre. The route also follows the old</p><p>Lincoln Highway, the first coast-to-coast automobile road in the</p><p>United States.</p><p></p>",
