  "fullDescription": "<p>This byway crisscrosses through the heart of central Acadiana\r\nand has so many points of interest that you could easily spend a\r\nweek on it and not see everything there is to see. So, your best\r\nbet is to cover the trail in segments over a period of time,\r\npossibly on a two- or three-day trip.</p>\r\n<p>A Trip Thru the Marshland: Walking on the Wild Side</p>\r\n<p>From Abbeville, the southern leg of the Jean Laffite Scenic\r\nByway begins on Hwy. 82 South. Also known as the Hug-the-Coast\r\nHighway, this scenic roadway eventually travels through some of the\r\nmost extensive marshlands in North America. But between the town of\r\nPerry and the Intracoastal Waterway, the drive winds through\r\npicturesque scenes of cultivated crawfish ponds and verdant rice\r\nand sugarcane fields, with farmers on tractors working their crops\r\nand old red barns that are still in operation. The marsh is\r\nspectacular, especially in the spring when the marsh flowers are in\r\nfull bloom, including water hyacinths, Lousiana iris and other\r\nnative species you won't find in a typical nursery. On Hwy. 82\r\nthere are also nice spots for crabbing and fishing, one of them\r\nbeing Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge. You will know that you are\r\napproaching the Refuge, when you begin to see massive live oaks\r\nalongside the road. It is the best known wildlife refuge in\r\nLousiana, and one of the best known in the world. The refuge plays\r\nhost to hundreds of thousands of ducks, geese, coots, and many\r\nwading birds each year, in addition to serving as a resting area\r\nfor migratory birds.</p>\r\n<p>From Rice Fields to Fine Art</p>\r\n<p>Again starting in Abbeville, take Hwy. 14 west to Kaplan, a\r\nFrench-Acadian rice-farming community home of the country superstar\r\nSammy Kershaw. Vincent Refuge, a 640-acre tract of land for birds,\r\nis located north of Kaplan. Then you'll come to Gueydan, home of\r\nthe annual Duck Festival. Westward from Gueydan, is \"Lousiana's\r\nBeauty Spot,\" Lake Arthur. To the north, is Jennings, a town that\r\nhas beautiful Victorian homes, the W.H. Tupper General Merchandise\r\nMuseum, the Louisina Telephone Museum, and the Zigler Museum. The\r\nLacassine National Wildlife Refuge is your next stop on the Jean\r\nLafitte Scenic Byway, whose 33,000 acres are mostly comprised of\r\nfreshwater marsh.</p>\r\n<p>Fresh Shrimp, Victorian Homes and Wild Animals From Africa</p>\r\n<p>If you drive eastward from Abbeville on Hwy. 14, you will go\r\nthrough the towns of Erath and Delcambre, home of the Acadian\r\nMuseum and Shrimp Festival each August. Jefferson Island, \"a place\r\nof peace and beauty,\" is located just off Hwy. 14 between Delcambre\r\nand New Iberia. The \"island\" features 25 acres of landscaped\r\ngardens. Just outside of New Iberia, continuing on Hwy. 90, head\r\nnorth toward Lafayette, but visit the Zoo of Acadiana and the town\r\nof Broussard's Historic District first.</p>\r\n<p>Lafayette: Metropolis of the Cajun Country</p>\r\n<p>From stately plantation homes to world-class restaurants and the\r\nhip-swaying of tempos of a Cajun or Zydeco, Lafayette is one of the\r\nmost distinctive cities in the South. It is the home of two of the\r\nfinest festivals in the country- Festival Acadiens, and Festival\r\nInternational. In addition, the city also hosts the second-largest\r\nMardi Gras celebration in the country. Vermilionville and the Jean\r\nLafitte National Historical Park and Acadian Cultural center are\r\ntwo important cultural attractions in the city which a thriving\r\narts community. Among the art places to visit are the USL\r\nUniversity Art Museum, the Artists Alliance Gallery, and the\r\nLafayette Museum. For a little older art, visit the St. John\r\nCathedral, a mixture of Dutch Romanesque and Byzantine\r\narchitecture.</p>\r\n<p>The Last Leg</p>\r\n<p>North of Lafayette, the village of Maurice is one to visit for\r\nthe world-famous Maurice City Bar. Leaving Maurice and continuing\r\nsouthward on Hwy. 167, is Abbeville, the finishing or starting\r\npoint of the Jean Lafitte Scenic Byway, depending on how you see\r\nit.</p>",
