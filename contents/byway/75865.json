  "fullDescription": "<p>Prehistoric man, Native American tribes, European conquerors, colonists who settled in this region, and even tourists of the pre-Interstate Highway era have traveled the Heritage Crossroads network of roads for over 300 years. Present-day visitors to the corridor are like these earlier travelers -- attracted to the area because of its spirit, heritage, natural beauty and compelling story. </p>\n\n<p>In 1765, British engineers built Old Kings Road using the original paths that Native American tribes traveled along the east coast of the US from what is now Georgia and the Florida Panhandle. During times of conquest, English and Spanish armies moved troops and supplies along these routes. Ultimately, commerce and colonization replaced conquest, and the road carried stagecoaches, horse-drawn carriages and eventually station wagons full of settlers seeking new lives.</p>\n\n<p>Built in 1916 to bring travelers from the Midwest to Flagler County, the Old Brick Road is a more recent transportation treasure. Craftsmen laid each brick by hand. The portion of roadway that is part of this byway corridor is a proud member of the National Register of Historic Places.</p>\n \n<p>Through history and exploration of all that the corridor offers, today’s visitors are assured to have a compelling journey through time. As you pass through the roadways that make up the Heritage Crossroads Heritage Highway you cannot help but feel a sense of a time that has come and gone. What remains are the unique historical features, warm people and a sense of the “Old Florida” that is difficult to find in the 21st Century.</p>",
