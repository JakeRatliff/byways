The corridor passes right\r\nthrough Kansas City, in scenic and historic George E. Kessler Park.\r\nThe drive is significant for its historic and natural\r\nqualities.  \r\n\r\n<div><em>Historical Urban Design</em></div>\r\n\r\nCliff Drive represents a fine example of historic urban design. The\r\ndesign and planning effort of the byway is known worldwide.\r\nAdditionally, Cliff Drive and the surrounding park were uniquely\r\nintegral to the evolution and development of Kansas City as a major\r\nmetropolitan area.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<div><em>Natural Wonders in the Big City</em></div>\r\nCliff Drive preserves natural features unique to this portion of\r\nthe Missouri River Valley. Some of these features include limestone\r\nbluffs, natural vegetation, and wildlife. These features are\r\nparticularly unusual because they are located immediately adjacent\r\nto the city core, within a heavily urbanized environment.  ",
